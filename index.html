    <h1>What I Have Read Lately </h1>
    <p> The most recent thing I have read recently is stats online for my fantasy football league, specifically players stats, injuries, Trade Rumours.<br>
        Fantasy Football is where you have pick players from multiple teams and they "play for you". Its made so you can only choose a single player from a team and nobody else can choose them. The reading part of it is when you have to read injury reports and that's very important for fantasy football as if a player gets injured you need to see how serious the injury is, how long he is out for etc. </p>

    <p> The second part of reading is team stats and how individual players play. <br>
        I read the stats to see how players play whether it be on offense and defense and it helps me to "pick up" players for my team who might benefit me to win my week. Player Stats also show how good the matchup is for that week for example if the player is playing against a bad defense, they are estimated to get a ton of points. If the Defense has a good matchup against the offensive player you have, it isn't ideal to start him. </p>

    <p> The last part of the reading is about trade rumours and how it effects your team. <br>
        Trade rumours are important because say a good player gets traded to a team with a player you have, it could change up how your player plays that weeks so you have to really keep up with trades to make sure your players have the best chance to score points. </p>
